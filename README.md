# Kanye and "The Truth" 

## When it comes to thinking about the ways that the black community and disability intersects (which is part of what my research entails), the immediate example of the recent altercation with superstar rapper Kanye West and the various calls for mental health come to mind. West, widely lambasted for his series of media exploits the past few weeks after a tumultuous return to Twitter, has been the center of a negative media frenzy after he casually insinuated that the African American experience of slavery was a chosen one, and touted his support for President Donald Trump. While the initial reaction to his comments did not surprise me, the number of black supporters for Kanye did, and so I was curious about who and was supported his idea, not just in what he said, but more importantly in his perceived right to the freedom of thought, which he continously suggests, is the reason why he is saying what is on his mind. To Kanye, the expression of truth, or the ability to move away from the crowdspeak and freely articulate unpopular opinions seems to be driving his initial ideology, and so I wanted to see according to a data sample, who might agree and disagree with this particular idea. 

## Using Twarc, I initially considered targeting specific hashtags in relation to West's antics or his perceived personality, but I realized this skewed the kind of information I was looking for, since I wanted a relatively neutral sample size. So I instead settled on looking at a randomly gathered data set from tweets aimed directly at West himself, reorganizing the data to display the highest amount of tweets regarding particular messaging. I also was interested in looking at the particular kinds of tweets that were being presented. Organizing them as replies, retweets, quotes and original messages, I found that the majority of people were responding after messages sent either to them or at Kanye directly. And after rearranging the numerical data, I then selected the top 250 pieces and started looking into the specific uses of phrasing in each, looking at the 38 users who supported West's idea of freedom of thought, as opposed to the 41 users who specifically speak against it. What this told me initially however, is that it seems as though the general public is essentially split with their viewpoint over Kanye's particular statements. With the remainder as either retweeted message bots or support for or against West himself, I then looked specifically at the users' name, description, and their location data to try and figure out if they were African American and if this influenced their response to Kanye West. In doing so, this brings up some interesting observations on the nature of this kind of data analysis. I would agree that software like NVivo would aid the specific type of analysis I was looking at, with the addition of multi-genres, like YouTube video commentary, or embedded Facebook statuses, but the main issue I have with this is the idea of interpretation. 

## Because Twitter as a medium revolves around the idea of lightning fast response, and a kind of knee-jerk response mechanism in the form of retweets, I feel like information tied to particular user names could be misused or misinterpreted by someone who isn't as invested in the specifics of the circumstance. As a follower and fellow fan of West, I generally understand the ideas coming from the music scene or people who look at him as a critical artist, virtuoso and fellow music enthusist, which would explain the general anger coming from the crowd. However, someone who doesn't understand or follow his music might mistake viewpoints, phrases and words taken in a particular context for meaning something they otherwise don't (like Twitter users copying various parts of his lyrics to make a point against him ie "You still a nigga in a coupe"), could lead into a rather sticky situation of data misinterpretation which I think is a real danger of looking at Twitter simply from the point of text data and trying to gather meaning and words. Not to mention the eye-brow raising suggestions of time stamped, location echoed tweets which can offer a new level of paranoia against the already data-weary social media public. But to look at information regarding Kanye and his truth is to also see a kind of truth echoed against the people who are looking at his. Social media has a way of mirroring ideas and viewpoints against one another until all thatâ€™s left is a singular message. This, I think is what Kanye is trying to articulate. Whether he achieves this, however, is a different story.
